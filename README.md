This is school project for mobile app for pub.
DEVELOPMENT is halted and unlikely to restart.

It is react native project that was built on expo router (EXPO 52).
If you wish to replicate functionality, which is very time consuming here are required steps:
1. have expo dowloaded and working
2. create react native app
3. add listed files to generated app file
4. download required packages and make required changes to app.json(not listed here)
5. now you can use app by starting it with expo (f.e. npx expo start) or you can try to build it
6. when app launches go to login, if you get logged automatically go back
7. in login set user name as __dev__conf__ and login
8. choose your backend ip (third field) and return
9. app is now working and you can use it

    This assumes working backend server, more about it here
